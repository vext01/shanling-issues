# Shanling Issues

This is an unofficial bug tracker for Shanling hardware and software products.

Shanling manufacture digital audio hardware and software. Like all software,
Shanling products contain bugs. In the absence of any official bug tracker from
Shanling themselves, the purpose of this repo is to document bugs (and maybe
some feature requests) for Shanling products.

I want to be clear that this is not intended as an attack on Shanling and their
products. Rather, I'd like to help improve the products.

Note that this is *totally unofficial*.

Also note that the author is not employed by Shanling. Since no source code is
(or likely ever will be) published for Shanling products, the community has no
power to fix any of the bugs listed in this repo. It is our hope that Shanling
will take notice of this repo and push software updates to address these
issues.
